                <h2>HTML(HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
                <p>Tim Berners-Lee (TBL) in 19912 3 describes 18 elements that include the initial and relatively simple layout of HTML. Thirteen of these elements still exist in HTML 4.4
                Berners-Lee considered HTML an extension of SGML, but it was not formally recognized as such until the publication in mid-1993, by the IETF (Spanish: Internet Engineering Working Group), of a first proposal for a specification of the HTML: Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly's draft Hypertext Markup Language, which included an SGML Document Type Definition to define grammar. of the Mosaic browser used to insert images without line change, which reflected the IETF philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.6 Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing draft HTML + (Hypertext Markup Format) Hypertext), from late 1993, suggested standardizing already implemented features, such as tables.</p>

                <h2>HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol)</h2>
                <p>It is a transaction-oriented protocol and follows the request-response scheme between a client and a server. The client (it is usually called "user agent", in English user agent) makes a request by sending a message, with a certain format, to the server. The server (often called a web server) sends you a reply message. Examples of clients are web browsers and web spiders (also known by their English term, webcrawlers).
                    A LRU or uniform resource locator (better known by the acronym URL, Uniform Resource Locator) 1 is a uniform resource identifier (Uniform Resource Identifier, URI) whose referred resources can change, that is, the address can point to variable resources over time. They are made up of a sequence of characters according to an exemplary and standard format that designates resources on a network, such as the Internet.
                    
                    URLs were an innovation in the history of the Internet. They were first used by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 to allow document authors to establish hyperlinks on the World Wide Web (WWW). Since 1994, in Internet standards, the concept of LRU has been incorporated into the more general URI, but the term URL is still widely used.</p>
